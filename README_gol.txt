Once the app is running (see the README.md for instructions), connect to .../game_of_life/ on the url to access. 

On the app you can just click START and PAUSE to make the simulation start and stop at any moment. 
Also you can randomize with RANDOM and CLEAR. 

On the Canvas you can click on any tile to make it dead or alive at any moment, even with the simulation running.
On the canvas, you can also Pan using the mouse and zoom.

Enjoy!
